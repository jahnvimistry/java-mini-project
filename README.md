The Car Rental System is a Java-based application designed to manage car rentals efficiently. Built with Swing for its graphical user interface, it features structured modules for managing cars, customers, reservations, and billing.
The system allows users to view available cars, make reservations,and track customer details, including VIP status.
With a dashboard displaying key statistics, the application organizes its functionality through side menu options, each leading to distinct sections like fleet management, customer management, and billing. 
The use of inner classes helps modularize the application, while dialogs enable smooth data entry for adding customers and creating reservations.
This system provides a practical, intuitive way to handle essential car rental operations.
